I have chosen to present my personal resume in the form of a website, utilizing the flexibility and customization capabilities of HTML. This approach allows me to effectively showcase my skills and experience, while also avoiding the limitations and difficulties of traditional word processing software or LaTex.

In my opinion, using HTML to write my resume is a logical choice as I am well-versed in the language and frequently use it to compose notes and documents. Additionally, many code editors have built-in syntax highlighting for HTML and its shorthand, Markdown, without the need for additional modifications. Using HTML allows for more customization and creativity compared to relying on generic templates. I hope to showcase my unique skills and qualifications through this approach
